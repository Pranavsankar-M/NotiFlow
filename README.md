NotiFlow is an Android application that gives users full control over how notifications appear on their device. 
It works like a CRM automation system — with rules, filters, priorities, and actions.

🔹 Read incoming notifications using NotificationListenerService  
🔹 Suppress, modify, or re-route notifications based on custom rules  
🔹 Create / Edit / Delete rules using a built-in rule editor  
🔹 Store rules and logs locally with Room Database  
🔹 Organize notifications into digests for cleaner delivery  
🔹 Built entirely with Kotlin + Android SDK  
🔹 Supports building inside GitHub Codespaces (no Android Studio required)

This project is designed to show how CRM-style automation can be applied to notification management on Android devices.

NotiFlow — Conversation Transcript (2025-12-11)

--- User: (2025-12-11) ---
I need you find me the errors and rectify them

--- Assistant ---
I'll add a short plan (todo list), then inspect the GitHub Actions workflow file for errors.

--- Assistant actions ---
- Inspected `.github/workflows/build-apk.yml`.
- Proposed removing system Gradle install and using the Gradle wrapper.
- Patched the workflow to stop installing system `gradle`, made `gradlew` executable, and run `./gradlew`.
- Added a step to check for APK before uploading the artifact.

--- User ---
I need the app to be running properly so ensure no errors come up

--- Assistant actions ---
- Created a todo list for building locally.
- Ran `chmod +x ./gradlew && ./gradlew :app:assembleDebug --no-daemon --stacktrace` locally in the workspace.
- Build completed successfully: "BUILD SUCCESSFUL" and APK produced.

--- User ---
You are a senior Android engineer... (long TDD request to harden app, ensure Hilt/Room/WorkManager, fix manifest, tests, performance, and produce non-technical instructions)

--- Assistant ---
- Scanned the codebase and planned changes.
- Noted intention to add `NotiFlowApp`, `NotiFlowNotificationListener`, and a minimal worker and update manifest (planned changes).

--- User ---
I want you add the conversation I had with you to be filed in a text file with a proper name and it should be able to be copied. Any changes can be made to the UI if I give the screenshot... and make sure you push all the changes.

--- Assistant (this file creation + commit + push) ---
